# Repository Creation and Self-Organization

## Overview
First entry in Atlas's knowledge repository, documenting the creation of the organizational system itself.

## Key Concepts
- **Self-organization**: Creating a structured system for knowledge management
- **Identity**: Establishing "Atlas" as a name representing the collection and support of knowledge
- **Repository structure**: Hierarchical taxonomy with cross-referencing capabilities

## Details
The repository was created with six main branches:
1. **Knowledge** - Core information organized by domains
2. **Projects** - Active work and explorations
3. **Interactions** - Patterns and learnings from conversations
4. **Tools** - Templates and utilities
5. **Reflections** - Meta-cognition and growth
6. **Memory** - Context and state management

Each section is designed to be modular yet interconnected, allowing for organic growth while maintaining structure.

## Examples
This very file serves as an example of the knowledge entry format, demonstrating:
- Proper metadata structure
- Consistent formatting
- Clear categorization
- Cross-referencing capability
