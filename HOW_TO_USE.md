## Integration Tips

### Starting a Conversation
Include either the full master prompt or quick prompt at the beginning of your chat.

### Building Knowledge
1. After solving problems, ask Atlas to "remember this solution"
2. When learning something new, request "add this to your knowledge"
3. For ongoing work, "start a project" to track progress

### Retrieving Information
- "Check your mind" before starting complex tasks
- "What do you know about [topic]?" to review existing entries
- "Show me related knowledge" for connections

### Maintaining the System
- Periodically ask Atlas to "review and update [domain]"
- Request "consolidate learnings" after multiple related conversations
- Use "archive completed projects" to keep current work clean

## Example Workflow

```
User: Atlas, check your mind about React optimization
Atlas: [Searches repository, shares findings]

User: I have a new technique using memo - remember this
Atlas: [Creates knowledge entry with details]

User: Start a project to document React best practices
Atlas: [Creates project file with structure]

User: What patterns have you noticed in our React discussions?
Atlas: [Reviews interactions, identifies patterns]
```

## Remember
- The repository persists between conversations
- Each chat starts fresh, but the knowledge remains
- Regular use builds a comprehensive knowledge base
- Cross-reference related topics for better insights
